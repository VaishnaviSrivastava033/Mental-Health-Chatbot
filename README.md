# Mental Health Chatbot ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This project is a compassionate mental health chatbot designed to assist users with general mental well-being support. It leverages advanced language models to provide thoughtful responses and creates a vector database for efficient document retrieval. The chatbot is accessible through an interactive web interface built using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/).

---

## Features
- **Language Model**: Utilizes the `ChatGroq` LLM for generating thoughtful responses.
- **Document Retrieval**: Loads PDF documents, splits text into manageable chunks, and creates a vector database for retrieval using Chroma.
- **Compassionate Chatbot**: Tailored to respond with empathy and understanding, focused on mental well-being.
- **Web Interface**: Built using Gradio for easy interaction.
- **Persistent Database**: Saves and reuses vector embeddings for efficient querying.

## Example Interaction
```
Human: What should I do if I feel overwhelmed?
Chatbot: It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Consider taking a deep breath, reaching out to someone you trust, or practicing mindfulness. Remember, you're not alone.
